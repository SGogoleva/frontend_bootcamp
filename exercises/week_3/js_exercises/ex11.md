// The following exercise contains the following subjects:
// ● Order Of Operation
// ● If statements
// Instructions
// John and Mike both play basketball on different teams. In the
// latest 3 games, John's team scored 89, 120, and 103 points,
// while Mike's team scored 116, 94, and 123 points.
// 1. Calculate the average score for each team.
const sumOfArray = function(arr) {
    counter = 0
    for(i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        counter += arr[i]
    }
    return counter
}
let johnTeam = [321, 120, 103]
let mikeTeam = [116, 94, 123]
let johnAvg = sumOfArray(johnTeam) / johnTeam.length
let mikeAvg = sumOfArray(mikeTeam) / mikeTeam.length
// 2. Decide which team wins on average (highest average
// score), and print the winner to the console. Also include
// the average score in the output.

// if(johnAvg > mikeAvg) {
//     console.log("John's team is a winner")
//     console.log(johnAvg)
// }
// else {
//     console.log("Mike's team is a winner")
//     console.log(mikeAvg) 
// }

// 3. Then change the scores to show different winners. Don't
// forget to take into account that there might be a draw (the
// same average score).
// 4. EXTRA: Mary also plays basketball, and her team scored
// 97, 134, and 105 points. Like before, log the average
// winner to the console.
let maryTeam = [269, 120, 103]
let maryAvg = sumOfArray(maryTeam) / maryTeam.length

if(johnAvg > mikeAvg && johnAvg > maryAvg) {
    console.log("John's team is a winner")
    console.log(johnAvg)
}
if(mikeAvg > johnAvg && mikeAvg > maryAvg) {
    console.log("Mike's team is a winner")
    console.log(mikeAvg) 
}
if(maryAvg > mikeAvg && maryAvg > johnAvg) {
    console.log("Mary's team is a winner")
    console.log(maryAvg) 
}
// 5. Like before, change the scores to generate different
// winners, keeping in mind there might be draws.
